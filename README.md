# Fantasy Football Pi (The "War Room")

**A self-hosted, Python-based Fantasy Football platform designed to run on a Raspberry Pi (or local PC).**

It features a custom Auction Draft engine, weekly matchups with live NFL data, and a Commissioner "God Mode" dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

### The Draft Engine
* **Auction Style:** Real-time bidding interface.
* **Nominations:** Owners take turns nominating players.
* **Draft Board:** A public-facing "Big Board" optimized for TV display.
* **Live Budget Tracking:** Automatically deducts winning bids from team budgets.

### Team Management
* **Roster Management:** Set Starters vs. Bench.
* **Live NFL Data:** Integrated with `nfl_data_py` to pull real-time 2025 rosters (excluding retired players).
* **Validation:** Prevents submitting invalid lineups (e.g., too many QBs).

### Weekly Matchups
* **Schedule Generation:** Automated round-robin schedule builder.
* **Game Center:** View live matchups with side-by-side roster comparisons.
* **Scoring Engine:** Calculates projected scores based on active starters.

### Commissioner "God Mode"
* **League Settings:** Edit Roster Size, Salary Cap, and Scoring Rules via UI.
* **Complex Scoring:** Supports tiered scoring (e.g., specific bonuses for 40+ yard TDs or 100-199 yard games).
* **Recruitment Tool:** Admin can force-move users into specific leagues.
