// Generate mock fantasy football analytics data for testing
// Create a function generateDraftValueData() that returns an array of player objects
// Each player should have: name, position (QB/RB/WR/TE), adp (1-150), projectedPoints (100-350)
// Include realistic values - QBs have lower ADP but similar points to WRs
// RBs should be drafted early (low ADP) with high points
// Some players should be "value" (high points, high ADP) and some "reaches" (low points, low ADP)
// Export the function as a named export
