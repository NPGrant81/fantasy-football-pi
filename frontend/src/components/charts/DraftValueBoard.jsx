// Create a React component for a Draft Value Board scatter plot
// Uses Chart.js (react-chartjs-2) to visualize fantasy football draft value
// X-axis: Average Draft Position (ADP) - lower is better
// Y-axis: Projected Points for the season
// Players above the trend line are "value picks"
// Include sample data for 15 NFL players (mix of QB, RB, WR, TE)
// Dark theme styling to match our fantasy football app
// Make the chart responsive and interactive with tooltips
