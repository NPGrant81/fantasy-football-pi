## 📖 STORY NUMBERING FRAMEWORK

This project uses **Agile Story numbering** to organize features and tasks with clear structure for VS Code file mapping and development sequencing.

### Story Format: `X.Y`
- **X** = Epic/Feature Area (Major category)
- **Y** = Sequence number within that epic (Order of creation or execution)

### Story Categories

| Story # | Epic/Feature Area | Description |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **0.x** | **Backend DevOps & Infrastructure** | Docker, databases, deployment, monitoring, backups |
| **1.x** | **Login & Authentication** | User authentication, sessions, security |
| **2.x** | **Draft System** | Draft board, pick management, player selection |
| **3.x** | **Team Management** | Team customization, roster management |
| **4.x** | **Scoring & Rules** | Scoring rules, league settings, commissioner tools |
| **5.x** | **Free Agents & Waivers** | Free agent search, waiver processing, blind bidding |
| **6.x** | **Matchups & Standings** | Game center, standings, playoff brackets |
| **7.x** | **UI/UX & Polish** | Themes, accessibility, bug reporting |
| **8.x** | **Commissioner Tools** | Advanced admin features, voting, rule management |
| **9.x** | **Analytics & Visualizations** | Python visualizations, Plotly/Chart.js, AI chat advisor |

### Sequence Logic (Y)
- **Sequential execution:** When stories must be done in order (e.g., 0.1 before 0.2)
- **Creation order:** When stories are independent but numbered by when they were created
- Use `.1, .2, .3...` to indicate granular sub-tasks within a feature

**Example:**
- `Story 0.1` = Install Docker & Postgres (must be done first)
- `Story 0.2` = Cloudflare Tunnel Setup (depends on 0.1)
- `Story 1.1` = Basic login form
- `Story 1.2` = Historical data archiving (independent, created later)
