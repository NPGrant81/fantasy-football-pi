## 🧪 Testing Protocols

### Sandbox Environment
* **Goal:** Allow Site Admin to test features without impacting the active "Post Pacific League".
* **Setup:** Admin runs `python create_sandbox.py`.
* **Isolation:** Sandbox data is stored in a separate SQLite file (e.g., `sandbox.db`) or distinct League ID to prevent data bleed.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Before major features (like the Draft) go live, the Site Admin will perform the following scripts:

1.  **Draft Flow:** Simulate a full 12-team auction with at least 1 user disconnection scenario.
2.  **Scoring Check:** Verify complex scoring (e.g., 40+ yard TD bonus) calculates correctly against known NFL data.
3.  **Permission Check:** Log in as "User" and attempt to access Commissioner settings (Must Fail).
